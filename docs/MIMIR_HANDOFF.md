# Mímir Project Handoff

Updated: 2026-09-24
Status: IN PROGRESS
Handoff version: 1

## Purpose

This file is the operational continuity point for Projeto Mímir.

When a ChatGPT conversation, Codex session or other development session ends, the next session must read this file before deciding what to do.

Do not reconstruct project state from conversational memory when this file and Git are available.

## Source of truth

Priority order:

1. Git repository and current branch
2. docs/MIMIR_HANDOFF.md
3. docs/MIMIR_V1_EXECUTION_PLAN.md
4. docs/review/operations/
5. docs/STATUS.md
6. docs/ROADMAP.md
7. conversation history

If conversational context conflicts with Git or this file, inspect Git and resolve the discrepancy before continuing.

## Repository

Repository: NogueiraMaier/projeto-mimir

Development branch:
feat/mimir-operational-foundation

Pull request:
PR #1

PR state:
Draft
Open
Not merged

State verified from source commit:
a4943eaf8ae5e00eed859509d01e259750af6972

Development host:
gentoo-Dragon_IA

Development user:
jarvisdev

Validation VPS:
gentoo-Dragon_vm

## Production safety state

Production PostgreSQL:

schema_version = 1..12
version13 = false
mimir_ops role = false

Migration 013 has NOT been applied to production.

Do not apply migration 013 to production without explicit authorization.

Do not create the production mimir_ops role without explicit authorization.

Do not use real equipment for EXECUTE until the synthetic EXECUTE workflow and the required safety hardening are validated.

## Current milestone

Milestone:
MIMIR-V1-013

Last completed laboratory:
MIMIR-V1-013-LAB-06

LAB-06 status:
COMPLETED

The persistent READ workflow was validated end to end in the isolated PostgreSQL laboratory.

Validated sequence:

intervention.begin
READ intent
READ result
DONE / complete
intervention.finish
evidence persistence
report persistence
history API
report API
inventory verification update

Synthetic identity was restored after the laboratory.

Production remained unchanged.

## Last code bug fixed

The persisted workflow guard was reading the prior operation from the wrong JSON location.

Incorrect:

last_action.payload->>'operation'

Correct:

last_action.payload#>>'{action,operation}'

Regression fix commit:

148044569dab79a2faa902e1a7b51c691bb43353

LAB-06 subsequently validated the fix.

## Current hardening state

The temporal integrity hardening has been implemented in the development branch and covered by the local operational regression suite.

Code commit:

bbe6c2a90bd7e3f237c6f02b97bc93d11db6fd13

The PostgreSQL runtime behavior has not yet been revalidated by LAB-06B.

Synthetic EXECUTE remains blocked until LAB-06B passes.

## NEXT_ACTION

Validate the temporal hardening in the isolated PostgreSQL laboratory on gentoo-Dragon_vm.

The negative case must prove that:

completed_at < intervention.started_at

is rejected by intervention.finish.

The rejection must not persist a report or evidence and must not mark the inventory as successfully verified by that invalid finish.

Then run a valid completion with:

completed_at >= intervention.started_at

Only after both cases pass may the project advance to synthetic EXECUTE.

## Planned sequence

1. Update the isolated VPS validation checkout to the temporal hardening commit
2. Recreate or reset the disposable PostgreSQL laboratory as required
3. Run MIMIR-V1-013-LAB-06B negative temporal case
4. Confirm invalid completion creates no report, evidence or successful inventory verification update
5. Run the valid completion case with correct chronology
6. Record LAB-06B evidence
7. Update this handoff
8. Only then proceed to synthetic EXECUTE

## Expected next laboratory

Working name:

MIMIR-V1-013-LAB-06B

Purpose:

Validate temporal integrity of intervention.finish.

Negative case:

completed_at earlier than started_at must fail closed.

Positive case:

completed_at equal to or later than started_at must proceed according to the workflow rules.

## PostgreSQL laboratory

Host:
gentoo-Dragon_vm

Temporary cluster:
/var/tmp/mimir-pg13-lab

Database:
mimir_lab

Port:
55432

The temporary laboratory must not be removed until required evidence and backup/restore validation are complete.

## Completed migration 013 laboratory checkpoints

MIMIR-V1-013-LAB-01:
migration inventory schema validation completed

MIMIR-V1-013-LAB-02:
mimir_ops role and least privilege validation completed

MIMIR-V1-013-LAB-03:
peer authentication mechanism validation completed

MIMIR-V1-013-LAB-04:
controlled API with synthetic inventory completed

MIMIR-V1-013-LAB-05:
negative API and authorization tests completed

MIMIR-V1-013-LAB-06:
persistent synthetic READ workflow completed

## Do not repeat

Do not repeat LAB-01 through LAB-06 unless a later code change affects their validated assumptions.

Do not redo historical migration reconstruction 009 through 012.

Do not renumber migration 013.

Do not merge PR #1 yet.

Do not apply migration 013 to production.

Do not alter /var/lib/openclaw/workspace for validation experiments.

Do not provision the final Linux mimir-ops identity in production yet.

## Remaining major work after migration 013 validation

Historical migration 001 resolution or canonical bootstrap documentation

Permanent PostgreSQL memory workflow

Operational backup and restore validation

Interrupted intervention reconciliation

Evidence and report retention policy

First real equipment READ homologation

generic-linux transient set-hostname homologation

MikroTik READ homologation

CI

clean checkout validation

release security checklist

PR review

v1 tag

Maestro documentation update after Mímir stabilization

## Documentation roles

docs/MIMIR_HANDOFF.md

Current operational state and exact continuation point.

docs/MIMIR_V1_EXECUTION_PLAN.md

Master execution plan for Mímir v1.

docs/review/operations/

Detailed chronological evidence.

docs/ROADMAP.md

Future evolution beyond the immediate v1 execution sequence.

docs/MEMORY_V2_ROADMAP.md

Future memory v2 work.

## Resume protocol for a new ChatGPT session

The first action in a new session must be:

Read docs/MIMIR_HANDOFF.md from the current Git branch.

Then inspect:

docs/MIMIR_V1_EXECUTION_PLAN.md

Confirm:

git branch --show-current
git status --short --branch
git rev-parse HEAD

Compare the repository state with the handoff.

Do not guess missing state from memory.

Resume from NEXT_ACTION.

If the working tree contains uncommitted changes, inspect them before pulling, resetting or changing anything.

## Handoff update rule

Update this file whenever one of these occurs:

A LAB finishes

A blocking bug is found

A blocking bug is fixed

The next action changes

The development machine changes

The validation environment changes

A commit becomes the new continuation point

A production change is authorized or executed

A long development or ChatGPT session is about to end

The handoff must describe the next executable action, not only historical progress.

Before starting a new major phase, commit the updated handoff.
